# 153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
Q: Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e.,  [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become  [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

Find the minimum element.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Example 1:
```
Input: [3,4,5,1,2] 
Output: 1
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
```
## Answer

研究出Binary Search的理論後(見1011題的分析)首刷，使用 Lower Bound BS：
```python
class Solution:
    def findMin(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        lo = 0
        hi = len(nums)-1
        
        lastIdx = hi
        while lo<=hi:
            mid = (lo+hi)//2
            if nums[mid] <= nums[lastIdx]:
                hi = mid-1
                lastIdx = hi+1
            else:
                lo = mid+1
                
        return nums[lo]
```

        # DO NOT use left <= right because that would loop forever
        while left < right:
            # find the middle value between the left and right bounds (their average);
			# can equivalently do: mid = left + (right - left) // 2,
			# if we are concerned left + right would cause overflow (which would occur
			# if we are searching a massive array using a language like Java or C that has

            mid = (left + right) // 2
                        
            # the main idea for our checks is to converge the left and right bounds on the start
            # of the pivot, and never disqualify the index for a possible minimum value.

            # in normal binary search, we have a target to match exactly,

            # we do not have a specific target here, so we just have simple if/else.
                        
            if nums[mid] > nums[right]:
                # we KNOW the pivot must be to the right of the middle:
                # if nums[mid] > nums[right], we KNOW that the
                # pivot/minimum value must have occurred somewhere to the right
                # of mid, which is why the values wrapped around and became smaller.

                # example:  [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]

                # we know that the number at mid is greater than at least
                # one number to the right, so we can use mid + 1 and
                # never consider mid again; we know there is at least
                # one value smaller than it on the right
                left = mid + 1

                # we KNOW the pivot must be at mid or to the left of mid:
                # if nums[mid] <= nums[right], we KNOW that the pivot was not encountered
                # to the right of middle, because that means the values would wrap around
                # and become smaller (which is caught in the above if statement).
                # this leaves the possible pivot point to be at index <= mid.

                # if nums[mid] <= nums[right], we know the numbers continued increasing to
                # the right of mid, so they never reached the pivot and wrapped around.
                # therefore, we know the pivot must be at index <= mid.

                # not discard it by doing right = mid - 1. it still might have the minimum value.
                right = mid
                
        # at this point, left and right converge to a single index (for minimum value) since
        # our if/else forces the bounds of left/right to shrink each iteration:

        # when left bound increases, it does not disqualify a value
        # that could be smaller than something else (we know nums[mid] > nums[right],
        # so nums[right] wins and we ignore mid and everything to the left of mid).

        # when right bound decreases, it also does not disqualify a
        # value that could be smaller than something else (we know nums[mid] <= nums[right],
        # so nums[mid] wins and we keep it for now).

        # so we shrink the left/right bounds to one value,
        # without ever disqualifying a possible minimum

官網詳解有提到一個 Inflection Point，讓我原本想的概念更明確成為解法，這也延伸出我重寫出一個比較好理解的寫法如下，打敗 89%
```python
class Solution(object):
    def findMin(self, nums):

        if nums[hi]>nums[lo]:
            return nums[lo]
        
        while lo<hi:
            mid=(lo+hi)/2
            
            if mid==lo:

            if nums[mid]>nums[0]:
