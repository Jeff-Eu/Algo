# Q1. Process and Thread
Q: Please write a brief explanation of Processes/Threads.
Also, please compare the differences of the two in your explanation.

My Answer:
```
Process and Threads are both execution entities which require CPU resources, memory space and data access.

Threads are within a process. A thread is a basic unit of CPU utilization; it comprises a thread ID, a program
counter, a register set, and a stack.

Each process runs in separate memory spaces. But the threads in a process have shared memory spaces.
